    <h3>A Search form is another commmon non-linear way to navigate through a website.</h3>

    <form>
        <input type="search" name="q" placeholder="Search query">

    <h3>Here is our page's main content</h3>

    <main>

        <p>main is for content unique to this page. Use main only once per page, and put it directly inside body. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.</p>

        <h4>It contains an article</h4>
        <article>
            <h2>H2 Heading</h2>
            
            <p>Articles enclose a block of releated content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page.</p>
            <h3>H3 Subsection</h3>
            <p>section is similar to article, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality. Its considered best practice to begin each section with a heading.</p>
            <p>You can break articles into different sections or sections into different articles.</p>
            <h3>Span</h3>
            <p>A span is a non-semantic element which you should use only if you can't think of a better semantic text element to wrap your content.</p>

            <h3>Div</h3>
            <p>A div is a block lelevl non-semantic element which you should use if you can't think of a better semantic block element to use, or you don't want to add any specific meaning.</p>

            <p>Line<br>break</p>
            <p>Horizontal<hr> break "hr" in angle brackets</p>

        </article>

        
        <aside>
            <h2>Related</h2>
            <p>the aside content can also be nested within the main content</p>
